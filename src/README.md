# Introduction

This book contains documentation for the battle simulator I am developing based on the rule set detailed on d20pfsrd. The simulator is a videogame built in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language using the [Bevy engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

The current code for the battle simulator can be seen on in this [github repository](https://github.com/josephleblanc/dungeon-copy).
