# Attack System
The attack system is responsible for handling the implementation of attacks. This includes several subsystems, which include systems for both the attacker and the defender.

The systems which manage the calculation of stats for the attacker are:
* attack roll modifiers
* critical threat range
* critical multiplier
* damage roll modifiers

The systems which manage the calculation of stats for the defender are:

* armor class modifiers
* damage reduction (DR)
* resistance (unimplemented)
