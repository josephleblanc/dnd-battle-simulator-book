# Origin Overview
The d20 rules around [ initiative
](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative) are described
on d20pfsrd's website. The following is a quote from d20pfsrd suffices to
describe the intended behavior of the game's implementation of initiative:

"At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An
initiative check is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or her
Dexterity modifier to the roll, as well as other modifiers from feats, spells,
and other effects. Characters act in order, counting down from the highest
result to the lowest. In every round that follows, the characters act in the
same order (unless a character takes an action that results in his or her
initiative changing; see Special Initiative Actions).

"If two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the combatants
who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier (highest first). If there
is still a tie, the tied characters should roll to determine which one of them
goes before the other." - [d20pfsrd](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Combat/#TOC-Initiative)
