# The d20 Attack System The d20 attack system uses a combination of a
random d20 die roll and various modifiers to the accuracy of an attack
and the armor class of the defender to determine the outcome of an
attack. If one were playing with the pen and paper rules, the system
would be as follows:
1. Choose a valid target for the attack 
2. Calculate your attack bonus 
3. Roll a d20 and add the attack bonus to the result 
4. Calculate the defender's armor class 
5. Compare the outcome of the attack roll with the added attack bonus. If
   the outcome is equal to or higher than the AC of the defender, the
attack hits.
6. If the attack roll was a natural 20 on the d20 die, calculate critical
   damage. If the attack roll was within the critical range for the
weapon and was a hit, roll the attack die again with all appropriate
modifiers and if this second roll is a hit, roll critical damage. If the
attack is a hit and is not within the critical range, calculate regular
damage.

### A note on modifiers There are a great number of attack roll
There are many modifiers, armor class modifiers, and damage modifiers, which are
only applied in rare circumstances. For example, [ Dwarves
](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf/) have a racial trait
*Hatred*, which adds +1 on attack rolls against orcs and goblins. There is
another Dwarf trait, *Defensive Training*, which gives Dwarves a +4 dodge bonus
against monsters of the giant subtype. 

These are just two examples for dwarves, but there are dozens of highly specific
modifiers which may or may not be relevant to any given attack. The attack
system as a whole must be robust enough to accommodate many subsystems which are
responsible for these modifiers.
